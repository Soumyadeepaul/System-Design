ðŸ§  1. AI Chatbot Command Executor

Youâ€™re building an AI assistant that can perform different tasks based on user messages â€” like:

PlaySongCommand

SendEmailCommand

SetAlarmCommand

OpenAppCommand

Each request (text command) should be converted into a Command object and executed by an AssistantInvoker.
New commands should be easy to add without changing the invokerâ€™s logic.
