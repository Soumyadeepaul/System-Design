ðŸ§© Problem Statement: Plug Adapter for Media Players

You are designing a media player system that can play MP3 audio files by default.
Now, your system needs to support additional audio formats like MP4, VLC, and MKV, 
but you cannot modify the existing MediaPlayer interface 
(since itâ€™s already being used in production).

To make the system compatible with new formats without changing the existing code, 
you need to design an Adapter that allows the MediaPlayer interface to play these 
new formats by internally using AdvancedMediaPlayer implementations.
